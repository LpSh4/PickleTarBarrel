 - Wrong usage of BEM methodology. Look into that.
 - Wrong usage of pixels. Should start using percents or adaptive units more often (rubber adaptive).
 - Wrong usage of margins/gaps. Should pay more attention.
 - Wrong dimensions (1440x1920 in design, 1920x1080 in project). Should pay more attention, may consider to rewrite a code to be responsive. 
 - Not every parent has its own size (width/height). Should use that more.
 - Should start using @media

 - I need to specify gaps in pixels
 - Look into using flex-wrap attribute
 - Not each media needs complete rebuild of each element. Small changes like gaps and autowrapping is more pleasing and shorter in code
 - Should specify the max-size (2k) for HTML or body. Sometimes it is more fitting to set main to fixed size and center it relative to HTML, leaving footer and header as fixed elements.
 - Using ul-li with semantics requires using it only in right places (Actual lists or navigation items)
